# Discord Mention All
_Lets you do **@everyone** without permission_

All you need to do is configure settings inside `Settings.kt` and then send
the signal message to the server you want to mention all.

**How do I protect my Discord server from this software?**  
You can use any Discord bot that prevents mass-mention.  
I personally use [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz), just go to the
moderator plugin settings and enable delete message & warn author for mass mention.
