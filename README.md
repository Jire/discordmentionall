# Discord Mention All
_Lets you do **@everyone** without permission_

### What's the setup process?

Since this software is deliberately malicious, I will not release binaries for it.  
If you want to use it, you must compile it from the source code.

Just configure settings inside `Settings.kt` then signal message  
to the Discord server you want to mention all on.

### How do I get my Discord token?

### How do I protect my Discord server from this software?

You can use any Discord bot that prevents mass-mention.  
I personally use [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz), just go to the
moderator plugin settings and enable delete message & warn author for mass mention.
